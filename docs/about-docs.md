# About these docs

Hi, I'm Siobhan. I'm a technical writer, technical editor, UX writer, and information strategist. 

I'm using these docs as a portfolio item to demonstrate an approach to [Diataxis authoring](https://diataxis.fr/). 

## Audience and aims

The intended audience for these docs are beginner crocheters who either want to advance their crochet knowledge, or who have come straight to making granny squares despite it being slightly more advanced (this is very common!). I’ve aimed for an authoritative but reassuring tone, with clear prerequisite information and tightly-scoped explanation. 

The goal of these docs is to make a complicated task feel as approachable as possible, and to set realistic expectations that there are likely some new concepts in the task that the user needs to pay attention to.

## Tooling
The publishing tools for this docset are MKDocs, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Github Actions.
