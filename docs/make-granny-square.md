# Make a granny square

In this tutorial, you’ll make a crochet granny square with a single colour or skein of yarn.

## Before you start

This tutorial assumes that you already know the following:

* US crochet terminology (see [Granny square glossary](glossary.md))  
* Chain stitch (ch)  
* Double crochet (dc)  
* Slip stitch (sl st)

You need the following equipment: 

* A cotton or acrylic yarn of your choice (**Tip**: chunkier yarns are better for learning)  
* A crochet hook at the right size for your yarn (check the yarn label, or use a [wraps-per-inch converter tool](https://www.crochetguru.com/standard-yarn-weight-chart.html))  
* A set of stitch markers (you need at least five)

## Make a crochet granny square

Because this is a beginner tutorial, I’ll provide plain English instructions alongside the standard crochet notation. 

Row 0 makes your starting circle. 

> **Row 0:** ch 4, sl st into the first chain, put stitch marker in ch4 sp  

**Plain English:** 

1. Make a slip knot to attach the yarn to your crochet hook, and make 4 chains.   
2. Slip-stitch into the first chain you made. This should make a closed circle of 4 chains.   
3. Put a stitch marker in the circle, so that you can identify it later.

>**Row 1:** ch 3 (counts as first dc here and throughout), 2 dc in ch4 sp, \[ch 2, 3 dc in ch4 sp\] \* 3, ch 2, ss to 3rd st in starting ch. (stitches: 12dc, 8ch) 

**Plain English:**

1. Chain 3\. This creates your first double crochet, and gets your working yarn to the right height to create your first row.   
   (**Note**: Always place a stitch marker in the third chain you make, because you’ll need it later.)  
2. Make 2 double crochets **into the circle you made in Row 0**. This is different to regular crochet: you’re not crocheting into the stitch, but underneath it. You should now have 3 double crochets in total (known as a “granny cluster”), making the first side of your first square.   
3. Chain 2 (this makes a corner), then make another granny cluster into the circle from **Row 0** (this makes another granny cluster).   
4. Repeat step 3 twice more. You should now have 3 corners, and 4 granny clusters.  
5. To make your final corner and close the row, chain 2 and then slip-stitch into the 3rd chain from your original starting stitch.   
6. Lay your piece out flat. You should have 4 granny clusters making up the sides of your square, and 4 chain-2 spaces that make the corners.   
7. Place a stitch marker in each corner, to help you identify them while you work the next row.

Next, let’s make that square bigger. **Row 2** works into the chain-2 spaces of **Row 1**. In each corner, we’ll add a granny cluster, a chain-2 space, and another granny cluster. Remember that **you’re always working into the spaces between granny clusters**, and not into the granny clusters themselves.

>**Row 2:** ch 3, sk 3dc, \[(3dc, ch 2, 3dc) in ch2 sp\] \* 3, (3dc, ch2, 2dc) in ch2 sp, ss to 3rd st in starting ch3. (stitches: 24dc, 8ch)

**Plain English:**

1. Chain 3 and place a stitch marker in the third chain you make. On this row, this chain-3 will be the **last** double crochet in the **final** granny cluster you make (this will make more sense in step 5).  
2. In the next chain-2 space, make a granny cluster, then chain 2, then another granny cluster in the same space. This creates your first corner for this round.   
3. Repeat step 2 twice more. You should now have 6 granny clusters, and 3 corners.   
4. To make your final corner and close the row, make a granny cluster in the final chain-2 space, then chain 2, then make 2 more double crochets.   
5. Finally, slip-stitch into the 3rd chain from your original starting stitch. This should complete the final granny cluster.  
6. Lay your piece out flat. You should have 8 granny clusters making up the sides of your square, and 4 chain-2 spaces that make the corners.   
7. Move your stitch markers to the new corners.

Finally, let’s add one more row. Here, you’ll be thinking about sides as well as corners.

>**Row 3:** ch 3, 2 dc in empty sp, (3dc, ch 2, 3dc) in next ch 2 sp, \[3dc in empty sp, (3dc, ch 2, 3dc) in next ch 2 sp\] \* 3, ss to 3rd ch in starting ch3. (stitches: 36dc, 8ch) 

**Plain English:** 

1. Chain 3 and place a stitch marker in the third chain you make. On this row, this chain-3 is the **first** double crochet in the **first** granny cluster you make.   
2. In the empty space under your chain-3, make 2 more double crochets. This makes your first granny cluster for this row.  
3. In the next chain-2 space, make a granny cluster, then chain 2, then make another granny cluster. This creates your first corner for this round.   
4. In the next empty space, make a granny cluster.  
5. In the next chain-2 space, make a granny cluster, then chain 2, then make another granny cluster.   
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 twice more. You should now have 12 granny clusters, and 4 corners.   
7. To close the row, slip-stitch into the 3rd chain from your original starting stitch.   
8. Lay your piece out flat. You should have 12 granny clusters making up the sides of your square, and 4 chain-2 spaces that make the corners.   
9. Move your stitch markers to the new corners.

You’re done! You should have a completed, fully symmetrical granny square with three rows, creating a checkerboard effect.

## Making your granny square bigger

You can make your granny square as large as you want, as long as you continue to follow the same pattern shown on **Row 3**, and follow the basic rules:

* On the sides of your square, make a granny cluster in an empty space, and then skip over to the next empty space.  
* In the corners of your square, make a granny cluster into the chain-2 space, then make 2 chains, then another granny cluster into the same chain-2 space. Then go back to making sides until you reach the next corner.
