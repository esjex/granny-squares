Granny squares are one of the most common and identifiable crochet projects. They are quick and repetitive to make, and extremely versatile. You can use them and combine them to make blankets, clothes, home furnishings, and any other textile application. 

Granny squares introduce many new crochet concepts for beginners, including shaping, colour-changing, and working in the round.
